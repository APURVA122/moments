## Branch Naming Conventions

Use descriptive branch names for clarity:

- `fix/<bug-name>` â€“ for bug fixes
- `docs/<documentation-update>` â€“ for documentation updates

**Optional:** Include a short issue reference:

- `Fix user login bug #42`

## Pull Requests

- Ensure your branch is up-to-date with `main` before raising a PR.

- Use a descriptive PR title and include context in the description.
- Label your PR appropriately (`feature`, `bug`, `docs`, etc.).

## Reporting Issues

- Check the [issues](../../issues) to avoid duplicates.
- Provide a clear description of the problem.
- Include screenshots, logs, or steps to reproduce the issue.
