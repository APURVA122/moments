          The physical version of your book may not be ready by <strong>{calculatedDate.toLocaleDateString()}</strong> because it typically takes several weeks to gather contributions from all your friends and print and ship the book.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          But the digital (online) version will be available as soon as you order the physical book. So, as soon as youâ€™ve finished gathering contributions and ordered your book, you will have access to the digital version of the book. You can share this with anyone while you wait for the physical version to print and ship.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          The digital version of the book looks and acts just like a regular book. It has a cover and you can flip through the pages just like a physical book.
